Just pushed my Spaceship Titanic notebook from Kaggle to GitHub — using TensorFlow Decision Forests to predict which passengers survived the fictional crash.
I chose TFDF because it’s super beginner-friendly and handles messy data like a champ — no need for heavy preprocessing or encoding.
✅ Easy to use
✅ Handles missing values
✅ Highlights important features automatically
This project helped me understand how decision forests compare to other ML models — and how powerful they can be with minimal setup.
